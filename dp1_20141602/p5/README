if you want change example ppm file.

move your ppm file to inout directory and change name to "input.ppm"
then, execute code.

output name is "output_/problem/_/sequential or parallel/.ppm(pgm)"


ex) output_gray_par.pgm
	output_smooth_seq.ppm


ppm_example directory - > provided example


i use ppm viewer at window. IrfanView 64



******************* execute ************************

If you want each code.

./flip_seq.sh
./flip_par.sh
./gray_seq.sh
./gray_par.sh
./smooth_seq.sh
./smooth_par.sh


flip, gray, smooth mean each problem (a, b, c)

seq means it is sequential.

If you want execute all code

./run_seq.sh 
./run_par.sh
